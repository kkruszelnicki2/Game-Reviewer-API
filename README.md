Game Reviewer API is ASP.NET application written in C#. It's task is to handle SQL basic requests (GET, SET, UPDATE, DELETE). It connects to specified database and handles earlier mentioned requests with its data.

I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to create a database. Database contains information about games themselfe, their producers, their tags, reviews and reviewers. For the tests I used Swagger.
